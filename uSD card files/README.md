<b>THE FILES ABOVE ARE APPROPRIATE <i>ONLY</i> FOR RELEASE 1.02 OF THE FIRMWARE.</b><br>
The <a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight/blob/main/Agon%20light%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.pdf">Quick Start Guide</a> assumes that these files are present in the micro SD card in Agon Light™. It also explains what these files are and how to use them.

<b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b> Since its original publication, the Agon ecosystem has grown explosively. The community of developers is now much larger, and several companies are now involved in making and selling Agon. To support all this growth, all firmware documentation is now maintained in a dedicated website run by Dean Belfield, the firmware’s lead developer:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/breakintoprogram/agon-docs/wiki">https://github.com/breakintoprogram/agon-docs/wiki</a><br>
More specifically, the µSD card files appropriate for the latest release of Agon's Quark™ firmware can be found here:
<a href="https://github.com/breakintoprogram/agon-bbc-basic">https://github.com/breakintoprogram/agon-bbc-basic</a><br>
Copy the directories "examples", "resources", and "tests" from the link above to your µSD card. Then click on the latest release link to the right, and copy the file <i>bbcbasic.bin</i> also to the root directory of your µSD card. Your card should be  class-10 and FAT32-formatted.<br><br>
